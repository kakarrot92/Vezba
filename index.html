            <p><strong> Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12
                    March
                    1935), also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.
                </strong>

                Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
                long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals
                along
                the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").

                Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915,
                which
                later became <em>NASA.</em></p>
